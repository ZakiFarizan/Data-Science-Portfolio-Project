## Data Science and Visualization
- [ConDrossiers Employee Analysis in COVID 19 Situation](https://github.com/ZakiFarizan/Data-Science-Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Data%20Analytics%20and%20Visualization/ConDrossiers%20Employee%20Analysis%20in%20COVID%2019%20Situation.ipynb) : Analysis of employee retainment because of pandemic era. We used machine learning model to predict how many employee would resign based on several features
- NYC Yellow Taxi Analysis : Analysis of Trip Data in September 2021 including data cleaning and regression model for taxi fare amount

## Deep Learning
- Natural Languange Processing : Build NLP model using Conventional Neural Network (CNN) to classifies emotion based on sentence
- Time Series : Build deel learning model using CNN to model time series dataset (Silver Price 1990-2020)
- Image Classification : Build image classification model using terrain dataset
