# Data-Science-Portfolio-Project
This repository include all of my data science and machine learning project. I hope you all can give me feedback about my work :)

Tools:
- **Python:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, Tensorflow, Keras

## Data Science and Visualization
- [ConDrossiers Employee Analysis in COVID 19 Situation](ConDrossiers Employee Analysis in COVID 19 Situation.ipynb) : Analysis of employee retainment because of pandemic era. We used machine learning model to predict how many employee would resign based on several features
- NYC Yellow Taxi Analysis : Analysis of Trip Data in September 2021 including data cleaning and regression model for taxi fare amount

## Machine Learning Model
- Natural Languange Processing : Build NLP model using Conventional Neural Network (CNN) to classifies emotion based on sentence
- Time Series : Build deel learning model using CNN to model time series dataset (Silver Price 1990-2020)
- Image Classification : Build image classification model using terrain dataset
