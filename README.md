## Data Science and Visualization
- [ConDrossiers Employee Analysis in COVID 19 Situation](https://github.com/ZakiFarizan/Data-Science-Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Data%20Analytics%20and%20Visualization/ConDrossiers%20Employee%20Analysis%20in%20COVID%2019%20Situation.ipynb) : Analysis of employee retainment because of pandemic era. We used machine learning model to predict how many employee would resign based on several features
- [NYC Yellow Taxi Analysis](https://github.com/ZakiFarizan/Data-Science-Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Data%20Analytics%20and%20Visualization/NYC%20Yellow%20Taxi%20Analysis.ipynb) : Analysis of Trip Data in September 2021 including data cleaning and regression model for taxi fare amount

## Deep Learning
- [Natural Languange Processing](https://github.com/ZakiFarizan/Data-Science-Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Model/Submission_NLP.ipynb) : Build NLP model using Conventional Neural Network (CNN) to classifies emotion based on sentence
- [Time Series](https://github.com/ZakiFarizan/Data-Science-Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Model/Submission_Time_Series.ipynb) : Build deel learning model using CNN to model time series dataset (Silver Price 1990-2020)
- [Image Classification](https://github.com/ZakiFarizan/Data-Science-Portfolio-Project/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Model/Final_Submission_Image_Classification.ipynb) : Build image classification model using terrain dataset
